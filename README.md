# Project Description
	
We will be making a website for a club called 40 and 8 this is a bar/club that it like a veteran bar and club for other individuals. I am wanting to make them a website to help make it easier for people to be able to sign up for memberships and pay their membership fees online. I also want to make a feature on the website to handle their raffles they have a weekly and monthly raffle so my intention is to be able to connect PayPal to the website to members can go online and pay their raffle fees and the winner for each raffle will be posted on the website. With COVID and everything it is very hard for them to get new members and for people to come in to pay their raffle fees so the website would help the company increase members and revenue through membership fees. I plan on making it very user friendly because of all the older individuals that are members so that they will be able to properly use the website and understand how things are working.
